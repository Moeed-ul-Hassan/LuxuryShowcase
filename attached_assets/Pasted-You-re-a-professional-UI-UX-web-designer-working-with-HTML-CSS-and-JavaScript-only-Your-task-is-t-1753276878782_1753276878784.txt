You're a professional UI/UX web designer working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. Your task is to design and code a luxury-themed, futuristic, and elegant portfolio website for a developer named Moeed ul Hassan — also known as "The Legend".

The site should have smooth animations, minimalistic yet powerful layout, and a high-end look that reflects class, intelligence, and tech-forward attitude. Use subtle glows, glassmorphism, animated icons, clean grids, and professional typography. Avoid childish or cartoonish designs.

📜 Journey (2022–2025)

🚀 2022 – The Spark

Discovered web development and started with HTML, CSS, and basic static websites. Spent late nights learning the core of the web — one line of code at a time.

Started freelancing and founded my own agency. Took on WordPress, Shopify, and static website clients. Became known for honesty, commitment, and fast delivery. Started working with real clients and real expectations.

🧠 2024 – The Shift

Shifted to backend engineering. Learned Flask and FastAPI. Worked on AI integrations, automation tools, Gmail APIs, and RESTful services. No longer wanted to just build — wanted to create impact.

👑 2025 – The Rise
